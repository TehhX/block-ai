# Block AI

A browser extension that blocks AI features on websites such as AI-assisted search results and chat.

**Why disable AI features?**

* AI-assisted search results can provide inaccurate, misleading, or outdated information.
* Relying on AI content may discourage deeper analysis and independent research.
* AI features can encourage less private browsing, especially when relying on non-local models.
* AI models often use significantly energy and water than traditional web features.

Block AI puts you in control, letting you decide when AI helps and when it gets in the way.
