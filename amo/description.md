Block AI is a browser extension that blocks AI features on websites such as AI-assisted search results and chat.

## Why disable AI features?

* AI-assisted search results can provide inaccurate, misleading, or outdated information.
* Relying on AI content may discourage deeper analysis and independent research.
* AI features can encourage less private browsing, especially when relying on non-local models.
* AI models often use significantly energy and water than traditional web features.

Block AI puts you in control, letting you decide when AI helps and when it gets in the way.
